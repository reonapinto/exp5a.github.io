<p>Ekart logistics or Ekart courier is an Indian courier delivery services company,
    headquartered in Bangalore, Karnataka.
    A subsidiary of electronic commerce company Flipkart Pvt. Ltd., it is run by Instakart services Pvt. Ltd.
Ekart delivers around 10 million shipments a month.[1] As of 2015, Ekart shipped 85 percent of products ordered on Flipkart.
    Klick2Shop Logistics Services International, a Singapore-based company, invested Rs.1641 crore in Ekart in October 2017.</p>
 <p>Ekart was taken over by Flipkart from WS Retail Services.
Locker services in stores and supermarkets running for all hours were introduced first in the country by Ekart.</p>
<p>Flipkart Group has given a go-ahead to its logistics arm Ekart for investments, acquisitions, and inter-corporate loans.
    The ecommerce unicorn has allocated $460 Mn (INR 3000 Cr)
    to Ekart for the investment deals, as revealed in an August 28, 2017 filing of the parent firm Instakart services Pvt. Ltd.</p>
<p>Flipkart is heading towards relaunching its grocery operations and a one-stop hyperlocal app to cater to all needs of an Indian 
    consumer. Thus, allocating funds to Ekart for acquiring other companies or investing in its operations will certainly help 
    Flipkart in ramping up its logistics services. Also, we can expect Flipkart to open
     new fulfillment centers in line with the rival Amazon India to penetrate deeper into the Tier II and Tier III cities.</p>
